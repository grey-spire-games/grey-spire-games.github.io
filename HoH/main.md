**Object:** Be the first to score 5 points. Play to 3 or 4 for a quicker game.

**Game Summary:** Players move and roll dice (representing heroes) to win battlefields, earning points by controlling them. Heroes of different types have different special powers.

**Pieces:** 
* 1 set of standard polyhedral dice for each player (one each of d4, d6, d8, d10, percentile d10 (also referred to as d10-0), d12 and d20), in different colored sets for each player
* Extra dice or paper for keeping score
* Differently colored dice, sheets or paper, or tokens to identify the locations of the battlefields, if needed

### Game Setup
Each player places their twenty-sided die (d20) with the number one facing up, off to the side. This is the Dragon Roost, where the Dragon (d20) stays when not in play. They then roll each of their other dice, the four-, six-, eight-, ten-, percentile ten- and twelve-sided dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d10 with additional 0s (percentile d10 or d10-0), and d12), and place them in their home (a space in front of them). These dice are respectively the Mage (d4), Rogue (d6), Cleric (d8), Warrior (d10), Paladin (percentile d10) and Barbarian (d12), and are referred to as heroes.


**_Board Spaces:_** There are 3 _Battlefields_ in a two player game, represented by 3 spaces in the center of the table. For each additional player beyond two, there is an additional _Battlefield_. Each player also has a _Home_ space directly in front of them and a _Dragon Roost_ next to their _Home_. Below are examples for 2 and 3 players. For 4 players you would have 5 _Battlefields_ and 4 _Homes/Dragon Roosts_.

#### Initial Dice Placement
Determine the start player randomly.

Starting with the start player and going clockwise, each player then takes turns assigning their _d6 (Rogue)_, _d8 (Cleric)_, _d10 (Warrior)_ and _d12 (Barbarian)_ (in the order they choose) to a _battlefield_. Dice must be assigned to a _battlefield_ where that player doesn’t already have one, if at all possible (in a 2 player game, each player will have 2 _battlefields_ with 1 die, and 1 _battlefield_ with 2 at the beginning of the game). Once each player has placed their 4 starting dice in _battlefields_, the game begins.

**_Dice terminology:_** When a die is attacking, its face up number is its _Power_. When a die is being attacked (also called _defending_), its face up number is its _Defense_. When incoming _Power_ on a die is greater than its _Defense_, that die is _defeated_. A _defeated_ die is sent to its owner’s _Home_ space (unless it is the _Rogue_ or the _Dragon_). All dice are considered _heroes_ except for the _d20_, which is a _Dragon_ (or is it will be referred to in expanded rules, a _Monster_).

### On Your Turn
Turn Summary:
1. March (move a hero)
2. Attack (pick a field to attack and roll dice)
3. Clean up & Scoring (removed defeated units and get points)
4. Reinforce (move another hero)

Here is a description of how to carry out each action on your turn, including special cases caused by the heroes’ abilities.

1. March (First Move):
 - You may move a hero from your home to a battlefield, or from one battlefield to another. You may also move from a battlefield to your home
  - If you moved a Cleric (d8), you may bring an additional hero from its origin to the destination (this can’t be the Barbarian - the d12 if enemies were at the starting point)
  - If you moved a Paladin (percentile d10), when they arrive at their destination, you may reroll all of your dice (including the Dragon) at that location. This is not an attack
  - If you moved a Mage, when they arrive at their destination, you may reroll an enemy die (including the Dragon) of your choice at that location
  - The Barbarian can’t be moved if there are enemies wherever it is
